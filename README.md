# Wireless-Smart-Glove-Controller-Senior-Design-Project
The project is about designing a wireless smart glove controller for simple games such as Tetris or Piano. Flex sensors and IMU is sewed onto the glove. Flex sensors is there to recognizing each gestures from the extent of bent in every finger. Deep learning, I2C, SPI, MQTT, ADC, Interrupts and much more concept is covered thorughout the project. Flex sensors, IMU, ESP32, STM32 were the hardware equipment that were used in this project.

The STM32 microcontroller first waits for a trigger from the user. The trigger is rotating your hand to right for at least 50 degrees. After rotation, the design makes analog to digital conversion on flex sensors and the output from those flex sensors is later fed to a trained deep learning model. The outcome is sent to ESP32 microcontroller and the message is published with MQTT by ESP32 controller for wireless purposes.
